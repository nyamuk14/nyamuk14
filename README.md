Hi, I’m known as **Nyamuk** — a passionate cybersecurity student with a strong interest in ethical hacking and digital defense. I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, where I explore various domains such as web exploitation, cryptography, binary exploitation (pwn), and forensics. My journey in cybersecurity is driven by curiosity and a desire to constantly learn new tools and techniques. Let’s connect, share knowledge, and grow together in the field of cybersecurity.
